# MOBILITY FLOWS IN SWITZERLAND (SwissFlows)

## Abstract
The main goal of this project will be to create an interactive map (focusing on Switzerland) showing all the information obtained from the geolocated tweets in a intuitively manner.
We would like to start by representing the daily routine of the users based on their geolocation throughout the day. We could then identify events that potentially changed these normal commutations. A timeline focusing on the different users would help identify such events since a disruption  (either occasional or permanent) in this routine would be visible.
By analysing the tweets’ content (including hashtags) we could identify patterns in the group behavior during certain events, like concerts, conventions, etc…


## Data Description
TODO

## Feasibility and Risks
⇒ Dealing with the visualization libraries and tools
⇒ The interactive timeline with all the functionalities will be difficult to implement.
⇒ Creating a kind of web application with parameters we want to input => creating a specific map based on these parameters.


## Deliverables
By the end of the project we would like to present a web page/web application with which the users would be able to interact, namely they would be able to go through the timeline to see the evolution of the mobility flows of the users, as well as see the same evolution in a personalized period of time.


## Timeplan
December => finishing everything to be free for the exams and Christmas :D
